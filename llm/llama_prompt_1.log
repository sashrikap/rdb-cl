User: You are training an autonomous vehicle in a series of ten environments to minimize the costs resulting from violations, such as going offtrack or overspeeding. In a series of ten environments, the weights learned from training in the one environment are used as the basis for starting training in the following environment. The environments are named Week8_01, Week8_02, Week8_03, Week8_04, Week9_01, Week9_02, Week9_03, Week9_03, Week9_04, Week10_01, and Week10_02.
The cost of running experiments on all ten environments in alphabetical and numerical order is 60.87. The cost on running an experiment on the same environment ten times is 110.66 for Week8_01, 43.49 for Week8_02, 43.49 for Week8_03, 43.49 for Week8_04, 106.74 for Week9_01, 106.74 for Week9_02, 109.90 for Week9_03, 88.76 for Week9_04, 43.49 for Week10_01, and 43.49 for Week10_02.
Give an ordering of ten environments as a Python list to minimize the total cost. You can train on any combination of the ten environments, including using an environment multiple times or not at all.

> Assistant:  To minimize the total cost of training an autonomous vehicle in the given set of environments, we can use a greedy algorithm that selects the environment with the lowest cost for each training iteration. Here's one possible ordering of the environments:
environment_order = [
Week8_01, Week8_02, Week8_03, Week8_04, Week9_01, Week9_02, Week9_03, Week10_01, Week10_02
The cost of training in each environment is as follows:
Week8_01: 110.66
Week8_02: 43.49
